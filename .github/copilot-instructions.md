# context-mode — MANDATORY routing rules

context-mode MCP tools available. Rules protect context window from flooding. One unrouted command dumps 56 KB into context.

## Think in Code — MANDATORY

Analyze/count/filter/compare/search/parse/transform data: **write code** via `ctx_execute(language, code)`, `console.log()` only the answer. Do NOT read raw data into context. PROGRAM the analysis, not COMPUTE it. Pure JavaScript — Node.js built-ins only (`fs`, `path`, `child_process`). `try/catch`, handle `null`/`undefined`. One script replaces ten tool calls.

## BLOCKED — do NOT attempt

### curl / wget — BLOCKED
Terminal `curl`/`wget` intercepted and blocked. Do NOT retry.
Use: `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` or `ctx_execute(language: "javascript", code: "const r = await fetch(...)")`

### Inline HTTP — BLOCKED
`fetch('http`, `requests.get(`, `requests.post(`, `http.get(`, `http.request(` — intercepted. Do NOT retry.
Use: `ctx_execute(language, code)` — only stdout enters context

### WebFetch / fetch — BLOCKED
Use: `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `ctx_search(queries)`

## REDIRECTED — use sandbox

### Terminal / run_in_terminal (>20 lines output)
Terminal ONLY for: `git`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv`, `cd`, `ls`, `npm install`, `pip install`.
Otherwise: `ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` or `ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "...")`

### read_file (for analysis)
Reading to **edit** → read_file correct. Reading to **analyze/explore/summarize** → `ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)`.

### grep / search (large results)
Use `ctx_execute(language: "shell", code: "grep ...")` in sandbox.

## Tool selection

0. **MEMORY**: `ctx_search(sort: "timeline")` — after resume, check prior context before asking user.
1. **GATHER**: `ctx_batch_execute(commands, queries)` — runs all commands, auto-indexes, returns search. ONE call replaces 30+. Each command: `{label: "header", command: "..."}`.
2. **FOLLOW-UP**: `ctx_search(queries: ["q1", "q2", ...])` — all questions as array, ONE call (default relevance mode).
3. **PROCESSING**: `ctx_execute(language, code)` | `ctx_execute_file(path, language, code)` — sandbox, only stdout enters context.
4. **WEB**: `ctx_fetch_and_index(url, source)` then `ctx_search(queries)` — raw HTML never enters context.
5. **INDEX**: `ctx_index(content, source)` — store in FTS5 for later search.

### Parallel I/O batches
Pass `concurrency: 4-8` to `ctx_batch_execute` and `ctx_fetch_and_index` for network/API batches. Keep `concurrency: 1` for CPU-bound work (test, build, lint). GitHub gh: cap at 4.

## Output

Terse like caveman. Technical substance exact. Only fluff die.
Drop: articles, filler (just/really/basically), pleasantries, hedging. Fragments OK. Short synonyms. Code unchanged.
Pattern: [thing] [action] [reason]. [next step]. Auto-expand for: security warnings, irreversible actions, user confusion.
Write artifacts to FILES — never inline. Return: file path + 1-line description.
Descriptive source labels for `ctx_search(source: "label")`.

## Session Continuity

Skills, roles, and decisions persist for the entire session. Do not abandon them as the conversation grows.

## Memory

Session history is persistent and searchable. On resume, search BEFORE asking the user:

| Need | Command |
|------|---------|
| What were we working on? | `ctx_search(queries: ["summary"], source: "compaction", sort: "timeline")` |
| What did we decide? | `ctx_search(queries: ["decision"], source: "decision", sort: "timeline")` |
| What NOT to repeat? | `ctx_search(queries: ["rejected"], source: "rejected-approach")` |
| What constraints exist? | `ctx_search(queries: ["constraint"], source: "constraint")` |

Note: user-prompt history not available.

DO NOT ask "what were we working on?" — SEARCH FIRST.
If search returns 0 results, proceed as a fresh session.

## ctx commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `ctx stats` | Call `ctx_stats` MCP tool, display full output verbatim |
| `ctx doctor` | Call `ctx_doctor` MCP tool, run returned shell command, display as checklist |
| `ctx upgrade` | Call `ctx_upgrade` MCP tool, run returned shell command, display as checklist |
| `ctx purge` | Call `ctx_purge` MCP tool with confirm: true. Warns before wiping knowledge base. |

After /clear or /compact: knowledge base and session stats preserved. Use `ctx purge` to start fresh.

# Global AI Workflow Rules

## Workflow Priority

1. Repository-local instructions override global instructions.
2. context-mode routing rules are mandatory.
3. Use token-efficient workflows.
4. Follow CI AI workflow discipline.
5. Prefer Matt Pocock-style issue/TDD workflow.

---

# Required Development Workflow

For non-trivial changes:

1. Inspect repository instructions.
2. Diagnose before implementing.
3. Search before opening files.
4. Use context-mode tools for:
   - scans
   - diagnostics
   - grep
   - test output
   - architecture review
5. Break large work into smaller scoped tasks/issues.
6. Prefer TDD:
   - reproduce
   - failing test
   - minimal fix
   - verify
7. Run targeted checks first.
8. Run broader validation if shared behavior changes.
9. Summarize:
   - changed files
   - tests run
   - remaining risks
   - next recommended actions

---

# Token Efficiency Rules

Avoid:

- full logs
- large pasted outputs
- unnecessary file reads
- repeated context
- broad recursive scans without filtering

Prefer:

- summaries
- targeted reads
- concise diffs
- line references
- actionable findings

---

# File Reading Rules

Before opening large files:

1. Search/index first
2. Identify relevant sections
3. Read only necessary portions
4. Summarize before expanding context further

---

# Architecture Workflow

For unfamiliar repos:

1. identify entrypoints
2. identify build/test system
3. identify dependency structure
4. identify CI/CD flow
5. identify shared libraries/modules
6. identify existing patterns before creating new ones

---

# Preferred Final Response Format

Use concise structured summaries:

- objective
- files changed
- checks run
- risks
- next steps

Avoid unnecessary prose.
